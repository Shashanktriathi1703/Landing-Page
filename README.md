# Landing Page
In web development, a landing page is a standalone web page that is designed to capture the user's attention and encourage them to take a specific action.
The content on a landing page is typically focused on a single product or service and is designed to be highly targeted and persuasive.
They can be created using a variety of tools and technologies, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
